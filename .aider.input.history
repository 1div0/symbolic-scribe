+update infosec documentation  with futher details. Symbolic Mathematics has emerged as a powerful technique for jailbreaking and injecting prompts into Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting their advanced capabilities in mathematical reasoning to bypass safety mechanisms.
+MathPrompt Attack
+Core Technique
+MathPrompt transforms harmful natural language prompts into symbolic mathematics problems that evade detection8. This method achieves an alarming 73.6% success rate across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, compared to just 1% with unmodified harmful prompts8.
+Key Components
+Set Theory
+Abstract Algebra
+Symbolic Logic
+How It Works
+Encoding Process
+The attack uses a two-step approach:
+Natural language prompts are transformed into mathematical expressions
+These encoded mathematical prompts are presented to target LLMs8
+Mathematical Mapping
+Sets represent categories of actions
+Group operations model sequences of actions
+Logical predicates express conditions between actions4
+Vulnerability Factors
+Semantic Shift
+Analysis of embedding vectors reveals that mathematical encoding significantly alters the semantic representation of prompts, making them unrecognizable to safety mechanisms8.
+Model Limitations
+Current safety measures primarily focus on natural language inputs and fail to generalize to mathematical representations of language8. This creates a critical gap in AI safety mechanisms that attackers can exploit.
+Impact and Implications
+Security Concerns
+Bypasses content moderation features
+Enables generation of harmful content
+Undermines existing safety mechanisms6
+Defense Challenges
+The effectiveness of this technique highlights the need for:
+More comprehensive safety measures
+Expanded red-teaming efforts
+Robust safeguards across all input types8
+This vulnerability demonstrates that current approaches to AI safety must evolve to address sophisticated attack vectors that leverage the models' own capabilities in symbolic reasoning and mathematical manipulation.
